Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. By leveraging large datasets and powerful computational resources, deep learning algorithms can automatically learn to perform tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. These neural networks, often termed as deep neural networks (DNNs), consist of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that process data in a hierarchical manner. Each layer of the network extracts higher-level features from the raw input, enabling the model to make more accurate predictions. Key architectures in deep learning include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image tasks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data.
